## INFORMATION

In this game, you have a pet dog to feed. So you toss the bone around and watch it move around.

Game Instructions:
1. To drop the bone, click on any cell and watch the dog run towards it
2. To move the dog, use arrow keys

This project was inspired by the player movement in the game Stardew Valley (mobile version).
I saw the mechanic and thought, `Why don't I recreate this for the heck of it?` and so I did.

Currently, to run this game, you must do the following:
1. Navigate to the ```dist``` folder
2. Run the exectuable file ```main```

Created using:
1. Pygame
2. PyInstaller

Algorithms used for Single Shortest Path:
1. ```BFS```
2. ```DFS```
3. ```Djikstra```
4. ```A*```

Future Work left:
1. Web deployment
2. Further Optimisations
3. Fix Bugs
